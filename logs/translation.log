 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper
and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and
lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.
[27] “Good luck old man.”
“Good luck,” the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole
pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row
out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out
to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see
them now the moon was below the hills.
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except
for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour
and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man
knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the
clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in
the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well
because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish
congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of
the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools
of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the
wandering fish fed on them.
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the
trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made
as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his
principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate
dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought,
the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong
ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean
can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so
suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are
made too delicately for the sea.
He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when
they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always
said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys
as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought [29] when the shark livers had
brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a
contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as
feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or
wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a
woman, he thought.
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his
speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current.
He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he
was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.

 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper
and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and
lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.
[27] “Good luck old man.”
“Good luck,” the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole
pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row
out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out
to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see
them now the moon was below the hills.
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except
for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour
and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man
knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the
clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in
the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well
because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish
congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of
the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools
of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the
wandering fish fed on them.
In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the
trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made
as they soared away in the darkness. He was very fond of flying fish as they were his
principal friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, especially the small delicate
dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought,
the birds have a harder life than we do except for the robber birds and the heavy strong
ones. Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean
can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and it comes so
suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices are
made too delicately for the sea.
He always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in Spanish when
they love her. Sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always
said as though she were a woman. Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys
as floats for their lines and had motorboats, bought [29] when the shark livers had
brought much money, spoke of her as el mar which is masculine. They spoke of her as a
contestant or a place or even an enemy. But the old man always thought of her as
feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours, and if she did wild or
wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a
woman, he thought.
He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his
speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current.
He was letting the current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he
was already further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.

 The Importance of Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle
In today's fast-paced and increasingly demanding world, the importance
of maintaining a healthy lifestyle cannot be overstated. With the pressures
of work, family, and social obligations, it is often easy to overlook our
health. However, the foundation of a fulfilling and vibrant life lies in a
balanced approach to diet, exercise, and sleep, all of which are crucial for
overall well-being.
A balanced diet is the cornerstone of good health. What we eat directly
impacts how we feel and how our bodies function. Consuming a variety
of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins ensures that the body
gets the essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs to operate at
its best. These nutrients are vital for maintaining energy levels,
supporting the immune system, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases
such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. In addition, it
is important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the
day and limiting the intake of processed foods, sugary beverages, and
excessive amounts of caffeine or alcohol.
Incorporating regular physical activity into our daily lives is another
critical aspect of a healthy lifestyle. Exercise not only helps to maintain a
healthy weight but also strengthens the cardiovascular system, improves

 The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought. Today I’ll work out
where the schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them.
Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait
was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were
down in the blue
water at one [30] hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait
hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and
all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh
sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on
the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was
not sweet smelling and good tasting.
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two
deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow
jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the
excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a
big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait
would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made
fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three
hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed
gently to keep the [31] lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite
light and any moment now the sun would rise.
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on
the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was
brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back
at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down
into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the water.
He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the
stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that
swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty
fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
But, he thought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who
knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather
be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not [32] hurt his eyes so much to look
into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far
inshore.
All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought. Yet they are still good. In the
evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the
evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky
ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then

mental health. Regular physical activity can reduce symptoms of stress,
anxiety, and depression by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood

cycling, swimming, or even dancing, can make exercise more enjoyable
and sustainable in the long term.
Sleep is often an overlooked component of health, yet it plays an essential
role in maintaining both physical and mental well-being. During sleep,
the body undergoes critical repair processes, and the brain consolidates

between seven to nine hours of sleep per night to function optimally.
Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to a host of health issues, including
impaired cognitive function, mood disturbances, weakened immunity,
and an increased risk of chronic diseases. Establishing a regular sleep
schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and winding down
before bed with relaxing activities can greatly improve the quality of
